# Robot-2023
Geneva Robovikes code for the 2023 FRC season. I am sorry...

## **How to Run the Robot**
1) Connect to the radio over wifi*, which should end in 3067.
2) Open driver station and verify the connection box is green.
3) Using VS Code, click on the "W" in the top right then select "Deploy Robot Code".
4) Once the code is deployed, go back to driver station and wait for the text, "No Robot Code", to switch to "Disabled".
5) Check to make sure you are on the correct robot mode.
6) Press "Enable" to start the Robot!

If things get a bit spicy, press space for an emergency stop. To restart the robot after, press the restart button on the roboRIO.

*You do not need to wait to connect, as soon as you hit the button you are good.
